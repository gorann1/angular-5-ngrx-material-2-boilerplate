# Wizard scripts

## Create a new component

To create a component for a new feature run inside the project folder:
```sh
sh ./scripts/create-new-feature.sh
```
Follow the instructions and, at the end of the process, you will have the new component's files created and injected in your source code.
In case something goes wrong, you can find a backup under the "scripts/wizard/backup" folder.
